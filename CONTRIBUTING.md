# Contributing

SmoothJS is a project for the community. You are free to contribute in any of the following ways.

- [Coding style](coding-style)
- [Fix bugs by creating PR's](fix-bugs-by-creating-prs)
- [Report security issues](report-security-issues)

## Coding style

Majority of SmoothJS core packages are written in Typescript. Having a brief knowledge of Typescript is required to contribute to the core.

## Fix bugs by creating PR's

We appreciate every time you report a bug in the framework or related libraries. However, taking time to submit a PR can help us in fixing bugs quickly and ensure a healthy and stable eco-system.

Go through the following points, before creating a new PR.

1. Create an issue discussing the bug or short-coming in the framework.
2. Once approved, go ahead and fork the REPO.
3. Make sure to start from the `develop`, since this is the upto date branch.
4. Make sure to keep commits small and relevant.
5. We follow [conventional-commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) to structure our commit messages. Instead of running `git commit`, you must run `npm commit`, which will show you prompts to create a valid commit message.
6. Once done with all the changes, create a PR against the `develop` branch.

## Report security issues

All the security issues, must be reported via [email](mailto:abdallah.r660@gmail.com) and not using any of the public channels.
